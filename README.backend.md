This backend was developed using JavaScript, with MongoDB as the non-relational database, and Swagger for API documentation.

To access the Swagger documentation, visit the following URL:

```bash
http://localhost:5005/api-docs/#/
```

The project also utilizes **Docker Compose** to run MongoDB in the development environment.
